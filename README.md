# Ruby's Internet-Connected Hamster Wheel

This project documents a connected hamster wheel built for Ruby, our beloved hamster. Using a Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266), a reed sensor, and a small OLED display, the system records wheel activity such as distance run, time spent running, and speed. Data is displayed live and logged for later analysis.

The project was developed with care and affection for Ruby, who lived with us for two years. It also includes reflections on animal welfare and the ethics of keeping pets in cages.

## Features

- 📈 Logs distance, running time, and speed in real time
- 🌐 Connects to Wi-Fi and displays data live
- 🕓 Stores historical data in half-hour intervals
- 🖥️ OLED display shows current stats
- 📊 Data exported and visualized via Excel/Pandas

## Hardware

- Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266)
- Reed switch sensor
- OLED display (SSD1306)
- adapted hamster wheel with magnet

### 🐹 In memory of Ruby  
This project was also a reflection on animal welfare. While we tried to enrich Ruby's environment as much as possible, we’ve come to the conclusion that even the best cage is not a substitute for a free and natural life. For this reason, we’ve decided not to keep small animals in cages anymore.
